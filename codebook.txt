The summarized data returned from the "summarize_health_data" function is
a data.frame of 66 total variables.

The first two variables (activity_name, first_name) describe the subjects and
activities. The remaining 64 variables describe a variety of features
recorded for each subject/activity combination. Each feature describes
a specific intersection of dimensions and is encoded in the form of:

    [domain].[feature].[summary](.[axis])

The 'domain' segment is always either "time" or "frequency".

The 'feature' segment describes the particular measurement taken from the
device.

The 'summary' segment describes the summary measurement. In the summarized
data set this should only include the values "std" (for standard deviation)
and "mean" (for arithmetic mean).

The final 'axis' segment describes which spatial axis (X, Y or Z) the
variable describes. Note that some measurements (e.g. "time.BodyAccMag")
do not have an applicable 'axis' segment.
